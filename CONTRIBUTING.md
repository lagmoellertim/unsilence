## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build. If any new folders/files are created that should be temporary, add it to the .gitignore file.
2. Update the README.md with details of the changes.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Once your PR is reviewed by a maintainer, you get feedback on your work. If there are no problems left, the PR will be merged in.
